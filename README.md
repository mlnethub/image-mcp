# Image MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for searching images using the Unsplash API.

## Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 SDK or later
- An Unsplash API access key ([Get one here](https://unsplash.com/developers))

## Configuration

This project requires an Unsplash API client ID to function. The API key should **never be committed to source control**. You can configure it using one of the following methods:

### Method 1: User Secrets (Recommended for Local Development)

This is the most secure method for local development:

```bash
dotnet user-secrets set "ImageApi:ClientId" "your-unsplash-api-key"
```

### Method 2: Environment Variables (Recommended for Production/CI)

Set the environment variable using the double-underscore notation:

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
$env:ImageApi__ClientId="your-unsplash-api-key"
```

**Windows (Command Prompt):**
```cmd
set ImageApi__ClientId=your-unsplash-api-key
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
export ImageApi__ClientId="your-unsplash-api-key"
```

### Method 3: appsettings.Development.json (Alternative for Local Development)

Create a file named `appsettings.Development.json` (this file is already in `.gitignore`):

```json
{
  "ImageApi": {
    "ClientId": "your-unsplash-api-key"
  }
}
```

### Method 4: launchSettings.json (For Visual Studio/VS Code)

Edit `Properties/launchSettings.json` (this file is already in `.gitignore`) and replace the placeholder:

```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "image-mcp": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ImageApi__ClientId": "your-unsplash-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration Structure

The application expects the following configuration:

```json
{
  "ImageApi": {
    "BaseUrl": "https://api.unsplash.com/",
    "ClientId": "your-api-key"
  }
}
```

- **BaseUrl**: The Unsplash API base URL (already configured in `appsettings.json`)
- **ClientId**: Your Unsplash API access key (must be configured using one of the methods above)

## Building and Running

1. Clone the repository
2. Configure your Unsplash API key using one of the methods above
3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```
4. Run the server:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

## Configuration Validation

The application validates that all required configuration values are present at startup. If the `ClientId` is missing or invalid, the application will fail to start with a clear error message.

## Files Not Committed to Source Control

The following files contain sensitive information and are excluded from version control via `.gitignore`:

- `appsettings.Development.json`
- `appsettings.*.json` (except `appsettings.example.json`)
- `Properties/launchSettings.json`

## Getting an Unsplash API Key

1. Go to [https://unsplash.com/developers](https://unsplash.com/developers)
2. Create a new application
3. Copy your "Access Key" and use it as your `ClientId` in the configuration

## Tools Available

- **GetImage**: Search for images based on a query string and returns image URLs with photographer attribution.
